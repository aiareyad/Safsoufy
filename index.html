      <b><span style="color: #d17b8f;">My baby,</span> you're about to read <b style="color: #d17b8f; font-size: 20px;">29</b> paragraphs, each with <b style="color: #d17b8f; font-size: 20px;">29</b> words, written with a silly grin and a full heart. I hope they wrap you in my love, even from far away.</b><br><br>
      Happy birthday, habiby. Today is yours, but somehow, it still feels like a gift to me, because it’s the day the world got its most chaotic, caring, stubborn sweetheart.<br><br>
      We’re not in the same place, but we’re in the same story. And even from miles away, you manage to make me feel more loved than people sitting beside me. <br><br>
      I miss you. So I wrote, because that’s what I do when my heart’s full and my arms are empty. Just words, but all of them are about you, habiby. <br><br>
      Remember when we first talked? I didn’t know you’d become home. The kind of home that texts good morning, listens to my rants, and somehow loves me more each day. <br><br>
      Long-distance is hard, but your voice at night? It softens everything. Your laugh across a screen feels like sunlight leaking through a closed window. Still warm, still real. <br><br>
      Your birthday playlist should include your laugh, your “yalla oumy baa,” and your voice saying “enty roh alby.” those are my favorite sounds, and they’re on repeat every day. <br><br>
      If I were there, I’d drag you out for ice cream, complain about the heat, hold your hand, and then silently wonder how I ever got this lucky. <br><br>
      You’re not just my fiancé. You’re my person. My best voice note. My safe space. And the only one allowed to eat fries from my plate without warning. <br><br>
      I can already see you reading this with that look, half smile, half confused like, “She wrote all this for me?” Yes. Because you’re the only one worth writing for. <br><br>
      On your worst days, I hope you remember this: even from another country, I’d still choose you. Every. Single. Time. With your flaws, your mood swings and your full sink. <br><br>
      I know you act tough, but I’ve seen the soft in you, the gentleness in your late-night calls, the way you care about my headaches more than I do. <br><br>
      Sometimes I imagine you standing in my kitchen, stealing bites while I pretend to be mad. Truth is, I’d burn dinner a hundred times just to hear you laugh. <br><br>
      You're smart, passionate, and sometimes completely impossible. But you’re also mine. And somehow, even when you drive me mad, I love you more by the end of the argument. <br><br>
      They say love is in the little things. For us, it's the emojis, the shared YouTube links, the “kalty ya habebty?” texts, and the shared silence that feels full. <br><br>
      I hope today brings you peace. And cake. And the reminder that someone in Alexandria is sitting in bed, smiling like a fool because she gets to love you. <br><br>
      You're the only notification I actually wait for. The one who makes distance feel like a detail, not a divider. The reason I keep believing in good men and big love. <br><br>
      This isn’t just a birthday wish, it’s a reminder. You matter. Deeply. To someone who sees you fully, wants you entirely, and can’t wait to spend forever cooking up chaos together. <br><br>
      If I could send you a hug right now, it’d last three hours, smell like my perfume, and come with a deep kiss you didn’t know you needed. <br><br>
      One day, we’ll read this together on a shared couch, legs tangled, coffee and tea nearby, and no more goodbyes. Just us, everyday, doing normal things like loving each other LOUDLY. <br><br>
      Until then, we make magic out of pixels, and turn voice notes into love letters. Our story isn’t waiting, it’s unfolding, beautifully, one message and missed kiss at a time. <br><br>
      I’ve seen couples with all the time in the world, yet no connection. We have connection that defies geography. And trust me, this thing we’re building? It’s solid gold. <br><br>
      Do you even know how proud I am of you? The way you handle pressure, show up for your people, and somehow still save your softest parts for me. <br><br>
      Nobody is perfect, but you are for me. Even your flaws are oddly charming, like your habit of forgetting what you were saying mid-sentence, or that fake angry voice. <br><br>
      I love how you challenge me, support me, and keep me grounded. You’ve taught me that love isn’t about grand gestures, it’s about consistent presence. Even from a distance. <br><br>
      You can see me now, but still, I hope you feel me deeper than just this screen. I'm right here with you, smiling, celebrating you, and quietly praying you're always this happy. <br> <br>
      Maybe I can’t kiss you happy birthday this year. But I can love you loudly, write to you softly, and promise that when we’re together, it’ll all be worth it. <br><br>
      Someday, we’ll look back at these long-distance years and say, “Look what we made it through.” But today, let’s just say: Happy Birthday, my love. You’re the best part of me. <br><br>
      Now go eat something sweet, wear that shirt I love, and pretend I’m right there beside you, rolling my eyes at your jokes but secretly laughing inside. <br><br>
      You’re 29 today. But to me, you’ll always be the boy who stole my heart, the man I’ll marry, and the reason I write 29 paragraphs just to say: I love you.

      <br> <br>Your Ayouya.
