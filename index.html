      <b><span style="color: #d17b8f;">My baby,</span> you're about to read <b style="color: #d17b8f; font-size: 20px;">29</b> paragraphs, each with <b style="color: #d17b8f; font-size: 20px;">29</b> words, written with a silly grin and a full heart. I hope they wrap you in my love, even from far away.</b><br><br>

happy birthday, habiby. today is yours, but somehow, it still feels like a gift to me, because it’s the day the world got its most chaotic, caring, stubborn sweetheart.<br><br>
we’re not in the same place, but we’re in the same story. and even from miles away, u manage to make me feel more loved than people sitting beside me.<br><br>
i miss you. so i wrote, because that’s what i do when my heart’s full and my arms are empty. just words, but all of them are about you, habiby.<br><br>
remember when we first talked? i didn’t know u’d become home. the kind of home that texts good morning, listens to my rants, and somehow loves me more each day.<br><br>
long distance is hard, but your voice at night? it softens everything. your laugh across a screen feels like sunlight leaking through a closed window. still warm, still real.<br><br>
your birthday playlist should include your laugh, your “yalla oumy baa,” and your voice saying “enty roh alby.” those are my favorite sounds, and they’re on repeat every day.<br><br>
if i were there, i’d drag you out for ice cream, complain about the heat, hold your hand, and then silently wonder how i ever got this lucky.<br><br>
you’re not just my fiancé. you’re my person. my best voice note. my safe space. and the only one allowed to eat fries from my plate without warning.<br><br>
i can already see you reading this with that look, half smile, half confused like, “she wrote all this for me?” yes. because u’re the only one worth writing for.<br><br>
on your worst days, i hope you remember this: even from another country, i’d still choose you. every. single. time. with your flaws, your mood swings and your full sink.<br><br>
i know you act tough, but i’ve seen the soft in u, the gentleness in your late night calls, the way you care about my headaches more than i do.<br><br>
sometimes i imagine you standing in my kitchen, stealing bites while i pretend to be mad. truth is, i’d burn dinner a hundred times just to hear you laugh.<br><br>
you’re smart, passionate, and sometimes completely impossible. but you’re also mine. and somehow, even when u drive me mad, i love you more by the end of the argument.<br><br>
they say love is in the little things. for us, it’s the emojis, the shared youtube links, the “kalty ya habebty?” texts, and the shared silence that feels full.<br><br>
i hope today brings you peace. and cake. and the reminder that someone in alexandria is sitting in bed, smiling like a fool because she gets to love you.<br><br>
you’re the only notification i actually wait for. the one who makes distance feel like a detail, not a divider. the reason i keep believing in good men and big love.<br><br>
this isn’t just a birthday wish, it’s a reminder. u matter. deeply. to someone who sees you fully, wants you entirely, and can’t wait to spend forever cooking up chaos together.<br><br>
if i could send you a hug right now, it’d last three hours, smell like my perfume, and come with a deep kiss you didn’t know you needed.<br><br>
one day, we’ll read this together on a shared couch, legs tangled, coffee and tea nearby, and no more goodbyes. just us, everyday, doing normal things like loving each other loudly.<br><br>
until then, we make magic out of pixels, and turn voice notes into love letters. our story isn’t waiting, it’s unfolding, beautifully, one message and missed kiss at a time.<br><br>
i’ve seen couples with all the time in the world, yet no connection. we have connection that defies geography. and trust me, this thing we’re building? it’s solid gold.<br><br>
do you even know how proud i am of you? the way you handle pressure, show up for your people, and somehow still save your softest parts for me.<br><br>
nobody is perfect, but u are for me. even your flaws are oddly charming, like your habit of saying "nefsy tsebeeny akhallas elgomla lel akher", or that sleepy voice.<br><br>
i love how you challenge me, support me, and keep me grounded. you’ve taught me that love isn’t about grand gestures, it’s about consistent presence. even from a distance.<br><br>
you can see me now, but still, i hope you feel me deeper than just this screen. i’m right here with u, smiling, celebrating you, and quietly praying you’re always this happy.<br><br>
maybe i can’t kiss you happy birthday this year. but i can love u loudly, write to you softly, and promise that when we’re together, it’ll all be worth it.<br><br>
someday, we’ll look back at these long-distance years and say, “look what we made it through.” but today, let’s just say: happy birthday, my love. you’re the best part of me.<br><br>
now go eat something sweet, wear that shirt i love, and pretend i’m right there beside you, rolling my eyes at your jokes but secretly laughing inside.<br><br>
you’re 29 today. but to me, you’ll always be the boy who stole my heart, the man i’ll marry, and the reason i write 29 paragraphs just to say: i love u.<br><
  
      <br> <br>Your Ayouya.
